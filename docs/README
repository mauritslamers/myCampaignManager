README FILE

Two Step Install for myCampaignManager:

1.  Read index.html in the docs/ directory.
2.  Do what it says.

TROUBLESHOOTING

1.  When using install.php, make sure the URL and the install path
    both end with a slash '/'.  For some reason at the time of this
    release, there was inconsistency in automatically adding the
    slash.

2.  Since this is the first release, if you have any problems that
    you can't solve, please open a trouble ticket on the SourceForge
    project page.
